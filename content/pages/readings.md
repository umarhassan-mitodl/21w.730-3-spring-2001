Reading Notes (Required for each selection in the packet)
---------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of keeping Reading Notes is to move you through understanding the texts we read (demonstrated in your **summary** of the main point in them, the first part of your Notes) toward responding and making analytical comments (in the **Notes and Quotes** section, or whatever you wish to call the second part). For the first (**summary**) section, write a paragraph or two on what you see as the main points of the selection, giving adequate explanations and perhaps examples. That will suffice to give you a record of the texts and practice summarizing.

In the second part, respond to what you have read: does it make you curious, sad, bored, hopeful, reminiscent, or other? Why? Try to pinpoint the parts of the selection that elicit your responses. Include quotations that you find interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise significant. This may take the bottom half of one typed page; it may continue to another if you list and respond to quotations. You might also analyze, or look at the part one piece plays in the whole text: does a passage repeat a theme; contradict an earlier passage; raise questions; answer them; or provide insight into the author's strategies, idea of self, and persona?

For example, your Reading Notes on "The Achievement of Desire" may focus on Rodriguez's description of his reactions to his family, of himself, of the process of education, or a mixture of these. Ideally, writing Reading Notes will help you formulate questions for your proposals and ideas for your papers.
