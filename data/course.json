  "course_title": "Expository Writing: Autobiography - Theory and Practice",
  "course_description": "Focus: What can we believe when we read an autobiography? How do writers recall, select, shape, and present their lives to construct life stories?\u00a0 Readings that ground these questions include selections from _Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl_ by Linda Brent (pseudonym for Harriet Jacobs), \"A Sketch of the Past\" by Virginia Woolf, Notes of A Native Son by James Baldwin, \"The Achievement of Desire\" by Richard Rodriguez, _The Woman Warrior_ by Maxine Hong Kingston, and \"Our Secret\" by Susan Griffin. Discussion, papers, and brief oral presentations will focus on the content of the life stories as well as the forms and techniques authors use to shape autobiography. We will identify masks and stances used to achieve various goals, sources and interrelationships of technical and thematic concerns, and \"fictions\" of autobiographical writing. Assignments will allow students to consider texts in terms of their implicit theories of autobiography, of theories we read, and of students' experiences; assignments also allow some autobiographical writing.\n",
